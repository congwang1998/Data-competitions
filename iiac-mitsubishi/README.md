# 第二届工业互联网算法大赛-装备赛道

The code is not allowed to open by the host, so I will briefly introduce my solution here.

## Key of this competition
- Be familar with data minimg. Because it's a 7days quick competition, with complex data and lots of sub-task
- Explore tha data, find the pattern manually, transfer the pattern into feature, validate the prediction


## Key of my solution 
- Find the pattern from visualization, then transfer it to feature. So I labeled the data manually first, which is not allowed. But I use the model to learn my label, which is totally fine. It's just an ugly trick, which works here for few test cases, but doesn't work for real application.
- Don't give up, but luck is not on my side this time.
